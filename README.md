"# Chips Library

## Description

This is doing the MDN Tutorial for creating a local library. (https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Server-side/Express_Nodejs)

I wanted to learn more about setting up the Express server and how they configured their files. This was fun and informative. I changed several things in it, most notably multiple authors. I attempted to write the code myself before going in to their code to read it. This was difficult because they used their code as the design documents.
